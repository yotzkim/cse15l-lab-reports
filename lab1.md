Part 1 - Installing VScode:
Hello CSE15L students! I’m going to show you all how to log into a course-specific account on ieng6. First, we’re going to install Visual Studio Code (VSCode), a widely-used code editor. Visit the Visual Studio Code website at https://code.visualstudio.com/ and follow the instructions on the page to download and install VSCode on your computer.

When you click download in the top right, it should give you different options to install VSCode on your computer. Make sure you select the version that is compatible with your computer!

Once you download VSCode successfully, you should see a screen like this or something similar (when you first download VSCode, it may give you a welcome page that asks you to specify certain settings)
